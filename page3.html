<p>Here is a summary of two videos on YouTube that deal with spotting red flags during job interviews. When is it time to walk away from a potential job.</p>
<h1></h1>

<div>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>High turnover</li>
<p>If the company is going through lots of employees, the job, pay, enviroment or culture is probably shit.</p>

<li> Sarcasm to dodge questions</li>
<p>They don't want to give you an honest answear to simple questions like: What sort of work is done here.</p>

<li> Unclear role (bait and switch)</li>
<p>The expected position and description seems to change depending on whom you ask. The description is vague and they aren't explicitly written down.</p>

<li> Salary expectations</li>
<p>Trying to get you to set a lower salary they can then use against you. Also works as part of intimidation.</p>

<li> Power moves (making wait, small chair, Holding off pay)</li>
<p>Wasting your time, making you feel less about yourself. Pressuring you to take the job or sign something without clearly reading it.</p>

<li> Rude/bored/not nice</li>
<p>Unprofessional behaviour. Cutting off your questions, behaving hostile or rolling eyes/yawning. They probably aren't worth working for.</p>

<li> Illegal questions</li>
<p>Are you expecting kids, are you single? Age, sexual orientation, religion...</p>

<li> Unlimited time off (programmer)</li>
<p>You will probably end up working more hours than you would have if you had a set hours to work.</p>

<li> Family culture</li>
<p>No. They can expect you to do things that just are crossing boundaries or working overtime to sacrifize for the company or aren't part of the official job description.</p>

<li> They don't ask many questions</li>
<p>They aren't so interested in who you are or how you can contribute. They are desperate to hire you showing that you might too leave soon (unnless former employee died or etc).</p>

<li> Negativity towards a coworker</li>
<p>Hostile enviroment. Could be unstable or uncomfortable enviroment to work in, different groupings of people.</p>

<li> Gotcha questions</li>
<p>Out of context questions that have nothing to do with the job and that have a right answear that is almost impossible to guess unnless you have some serious mental gymnastics. Just stupid. "What would you do if trapped inside a huge oven?".</p>
<ol>
